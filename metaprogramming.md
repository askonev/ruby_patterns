# Metaprogramming

Metaprogramming in Ruby refers to the practice of writing code that can modify
or extend the behavior of a program at runtime. Ruby is known for its
flexibility and support for metaprogramming, making it a powerful tool for
creating dynamic and flexible code.

Here are some key aspects of metaprogramming in Ruby:

1. **Dynamic Methods:** Ruby allows you to define and modify methods at
runtime. You can use methods like `define_method` and `method_missing` to
create methods dynamically based on conditions or user input.

2. **Open Classes:** In Ruby, classes are open for modification, which means
you can add methods to existing classes. This is often used for extending
the functionality of built-in classes or libraries.

3. **Method Missing:** The `method_missing` method is called when you attempt
to call a method that doesn't exist. You can use it to handle method calls
dynamically and provide custom behavior.

4. **Module Inclusion:** Ruby's modules can be included in classes to add
new methods and behaviors to those classes. This is a form of composition
that allows for reusable and shareable code.

5. **Dynamic Code Generation:** Ruby allows you to generate and evaluate
code dynamically using `eval` or other metaprogramming techniques. This is
useful for creating code templates or executing code from external sources.

6. **Reflection:** Ruby provides reflection features that allow you to inspect
and manipulate classes, modules, methods, and their attributes at runtime.
The `Object` class provides methods like `class`, `methods`, and
`instance_variables` for introspection.

7. **DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages):** Metaprogramming is often used to
create DSLs in Ruby. DSLs are mini-languages designed for specific tasks
or domains, making code more readable and expressive.

8. **Rails Metaprogramming:** Ruby on Rails, a popular web framework,
extensively uses metaprogramming to provide features like ActiveRecord
associations, migrations, and dynamic finders.

Here's a simple example of metaprogramming in Ruby to dynamically define
methods for getter and setter accessors:

```ruby
class MyClass
  attr_accessor :my_attribute

  def initialize
    @my_attribute = 42
  end
end

obj = MyClass.new

# Dynamically call the getter method
puts obj.my_attribute

# Dynamically call the setter method
obj.my_attribute = 100
puts obj.my_attribute
```

In this example, `attr_accessor` is a metaprogramming construct that
automatically generates getter and setter methods for the `my_attribute`
instance variable. This allows you to access and modify the attribute
dynamically.

While metaprogramming in Ruby can be powerful, it should be used judiciously
and with care, as it can make code more complex and harder to understand if
overused.
