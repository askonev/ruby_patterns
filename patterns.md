# Test patterns Ruby

There are several testing patterns and strategies used in Ruby to ensure the quality and reliability of your code. Here's a list of some common testing patterns and practices:

1. **Unit Testing:** Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions (units) of your code in isolation. In Ruby, RSpec is a popular framework for writing unit tests.

2. **Integration Testing:** Integration tests verify that different parts of your application work together correctly. They ensure that components are integrated properly and can communicate with each other.

3. **Functional Testing:** Functional tests, also known as end-to-end tests, test the entire application's functionality from the user's perspective. Tools like Capybara are commonly used for functional testing in Ruby.

4. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** BDD is a testing methodology that focuses on the behavior of the application from a user's perspective. It often uses a natural language syntax for writing tests. RSpec is a popular Ruby framework for BDD.

5. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** TDD is a development methodology in which tests are written before writing the actual code. It helps ensure that your code behaves as expected and meets the specified requirements.

6. **Test Fixtures:** Test fixtures provide a known and consistent environment for tests by setting up pre-defined data and conditions. Tools like FactoryBot or FactoryGirl can help create fixtures for your tests.

7. **Mocking and Stubbing:** In testing, you often want to isolate the code under test from external dependencies. Mocking and stubbing allow you to replace these dependencies with controlled substitutes. Libraries like RSpec and Mocha provide tools for mocking and stubbing.

8. **Continuous Integration (CI):** CI is a practice that involves automatically running tests whenever code changes are pushed to a repository. Popular CI tools for Ruby include Travis CI, CircleCI, and Jenkins.

9. **Mutation Testing:** Mutation testing involves introducing small, deliberate code changes (mutations) into your code and running tests to ensure that the tests can detect these mutations. Mutant is a Ruby mutation testing tool.

10. **Code Coverage Analysis:** Code coverage tools help you determine which parts of your code are tested by your test suite. Tools like SimpleCov can be used to measure and improve code coverage.

11. **Parameterized Tests:** Parameterized tests allow you to run the same test code with multiple sets of input data. RSpec's `RSpec::Parameterized` gem is one way to achieve this in Ruby.

12. **Test Doubles:** Test doubles are objects used in place of real objects in your tests. They include stubs, mocks, and spies. These are used to isolate code and verify interactions.

13. **Headless Browsing:** For web application testing, headless browsers like Capybara with a headless driver (e.g., Selenium or Poltergeist) can be used to automate browser interactions without displaying a visible browser window.

These are some of the common testing patterns and practices in the Ruby ecosystem. The choice of patterns and tools depends on the specific requirements of your project and the level of testing you aim to achieve.
